# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step 1: - Import the Required Library
- Import the numpy library to perform  matrix operations

### Step 2: - Define the Coefficient Matrix and Constant Vector
- Create matrix A containing the coefficients of the variables.
- Create vector B containing the constants from the right-hand side of the equations.

### Step 3: Using the np.linalg.matrix_rank(), we can find the rank of the given matrix.
### Step 4: - Display the Result
- Print the solution vector C, which contains the values of the unknowns.
